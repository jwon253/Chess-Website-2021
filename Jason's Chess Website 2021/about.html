                        <p> When a piece is moved it puts the opposing king in check. 
                        The king must get out of check in the next turn. 
                        The attacking piece may be taken by the king or another piece. 
                        Another piece may be moved between the attacking piece and the king, but not for knights. 
                        If the king is unable to move and is in check the king is in checkmate. 
                        The game finishes and the player who’s king in checkmate loses.
                        Stalement is a draw, it happens when one king is unable to move also not in check.
